This is our First Robotics code for 2018.

This year we are trying a gradle build via GradleRio.

We are also trying to actually write some tests.  We have been meaning to for a while, but they always get prioritized out of the build season.




## Robot Commands
```bash

# To build and run tests
gradlew.bat build

# To build and deploy code to the robot

# To just build, in the case that you broke all the tests
gradlew.bat assemble
